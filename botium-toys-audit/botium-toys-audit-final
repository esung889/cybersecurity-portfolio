# **Recommendations**

Botium Toys has several gaps in its security program that should be addressed as the company continues to grow. The most urgent needs involve tightening access to sensitive information. Putting least-privilege rules in place and separating duties will prevent employees from having more access than their roles require. The business should also introduce encryption, a password management tool, and a structured backup process to better protect customer data and improve recovery options after an incident.

From a compliance perspective, the company is falling short of PCI DSS and GDPR expectations. Access to payment data needs to be restricted, stored cardholder information should be encrypted, and assets must be properly classified so sensitive items can be safeguarded. Strengthening these areas will lower the company’s exposure to regulatory penalties and reduce the likelihood of a serious security breach.
