**Recommendations:**

Botium Toys should prioritize implementing several missing controls to reduce high-risk exposure. First, access controls such as *least privilege*, *separation of duties*, and a centralized password management system must be enforced to protect customer PII/SPII and credit card data. Implementing *encryption*, *regular backups*, and a formal *disaster recovery plan* is critical for maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, the company must adopt PCI DSS and GDPR best practices, including securing payment data, restricting access, and properly classifying sensitive information, to reduce legal, financial, and operational risk.
